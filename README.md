# Hungarian specific prompts for LLMs
The final essay's subject at the Catholic University Pázmány Péter, Hungary on Artifical Intelligence Application program was about evaluating the feedbacks from different Large Language Models.
My thesis focuses on analyzing the responses of large language models related to Hungarian culture, an area where similar research results are not yet available. Currently, the development and fine-tuning of artificial intelligence mainly concentrate on the English language, which often sidelines smaller languages, including Hungarian. This situation can disadvantage Hungarian-speaking users, especially where cultural relevance and linguistic specifics are essential. I posed 114 questions across six topics. The responses were evaluated based on five criteria: factual accuracy, linguistic correctness, relevance, style, and structure.
